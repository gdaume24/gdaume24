I am an AI developer, I did my work-study program at CHU of Caen.
During this period, I did a lot of data ingineering, application development, and AI to extract datas from raw text.

As a masterpiece project for school, I did an application to predict if the user needs a mental health treatment based on a survey.

I aim to find a job as a full stack ingineer.
