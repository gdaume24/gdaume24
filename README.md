I am an AI developer, I did my work-study program at CHU de Caen.
During this period, I did a lot of data ingineering, application development, and AI to extract datas from raw text.

As a masterpiece project for school, I did an application to predict if the user needs a mental health treatment based on a survey.

I'm now working for 2CConseil in Paris, for my master degree work-study program.
I do a master in Full-stack development in Java/Angular. At work, I do a mobile application with react-native and some tests for a website.
