Data ingineering, application development, and AI to extract datas from raw text.

As a masterpiece project for school, I did an application to predict if the user needs a mental health treatment based on a survey.

I do a master in Full-stack development in Java/Angular. At work, I do a mobile application with react-native and some tests for a website.
